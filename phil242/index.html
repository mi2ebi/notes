    <h1>what is philosophy?</h1>
    <p><i>philosophy</i> comes from two greek words</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ruby><i lang="grc">φῐ́λος</i><rp>(</rp><rt>phĭ́los</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
        'beloved, friendly'
      </li>
      <li>
        <ruby><i lang="grc">σοφῐ́ᾱ</i><rp>(</rp><rt>sophĭ́ā</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
        'wisdom'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>what's wisdom? necessary conditions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>get clear on <i>what</i> you believe</li>
      <li>get clear on <i>why</i> you believe it</li>
      <li>ask if the reasons <i>justify</i> the belief</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      what's justification? at minimum, would any rational, unbiased person
      agree that the reasons given are <i>at least relevant to</i> the belief?

      <dd>
        the study of (a) <i>what</i> exists and (b)
        <i>the way or manner in which</i> it exists
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p><b>(a)</b> what do people have trouble determining the existence of?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>quarks</li>
      <li>redness</li>
      <li>love</li>
      <li>god</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>(b)</b> if eg god does exist, what properties does he have?</p>
    <p>
      according to judeochristian tradition, god is omnipotent (all-powerful),
      omniscient (all-knowing), omnibenevolent (all-good), and "eternal".
      theologians actually define <i>eternal</i> as "existing outside space and
      time"
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>ontology</dt>
      <dd>the list of entities one claims exist</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>sample ontology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>rocks</li>
      <li>cats</li>
      <li>people</li>
      <li>the number 1</li>
      <li>loopholes in the law</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      how are eg rocks and cats similar? for one they're both tangible, or we
      could call them
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>matieral items</dt>
      <dd>capable of physical subdivision</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      how rocks and cats differ? rocks and cats can both move, but cats can move
      volitionally (making them <b>animate</b>) and rocks can't (because they're
      <b>inanimate</b>)
    </p>
    <p>
      what about cats vs people? people are also animate. how do people differ
      from other animals?
    </p>
    <p>
      we're not alone in eg our usage of tools - some other animals can use
      tools for example
    </p>
    <p>we're also not the only social animals, hm...</p>
    <p>
      the classic dividing line is that we can acquire and use languages. other
      animals can communicate but that doesn't necessarily mean they have a
      language. for example bird calls aren't a language because they don't have
      enough variation in meaning. but maybe eg dolphin sounds are, we don't
      know. if it is a language, maybe dolphins in different parts of the ocean
      have different 'accents'

    <p>
      what about the number 1? unlike rocks and cats and people, the number 1
      isn't a material item! it's abstract. does the number 1 exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      would numbers exist if people never existed? a <b>realist</b> woud say
      yes. an <b>anti-realist / pragmatist</b> would say no.
    </p>
    <p>
      would loopholes in the law exist if people never existed? i think not,
      because laws are made by people. people are necessary for "loopholes in
      the law" to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      some mathematicians claim to "invent" math, and others claim to "discover"
      it. if they discovered it, it must have already existed. we discovered
      mars but mars existed before people

    <p>
      flowers and pinecones and things have the fibonacci sequence in them via
      spirals and things
    </p>
    <p>the existence of numbers is actualy an unresolved question</p>
    <p>
      an argument for pragmatism would be that any number can form the base of a
      number system. we use 10 because we usually have that many fingers. but
      some people like 12 or 6 or 2

    <p>epistemologists try to answer:</p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      it's also useful to distinguish <i>in principle</i> vs <i>in practice</i>.
      in principle, we could know the soil composition of any planet in the universe.
      in practice we can't though, because our telescopes etc aren't that good
    </p>
    <p>edge cases: can we know, in principle, infinity? human consciousness?</p>

    <h2><i>the first meditation: on what can be called into doubt</i></h2>
    <p><b>&para;1.</b>
      descartes is demolishing his existing beliefs so he can have a stable foundation
      for new ones, both for his own benefit and for the benefit of philosophy as
      what-was-then-considered-a-science.
    </p>
    <p><b>&para;2.</b>

      find <i>some</i> reason to doubt each of them. here again he can go directly to

      this argument fails because cases of sense deception are eminently correctable

    </style>
    <p>what is it exactly that makes an action moral or immoral?</p>
    <h3>intention</h3>
    <p>proposal: just inspect the action! this doesn't work because you might not know the full situation. <b class="case">for example</b>, is it moral if i pull out a gun and shoot someone because</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        they were about to kill some random innocent person?
        <span class="yes">sure</span>, i'm protecting an innocent life

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b class="case">another example.</b>
      at 17:50 every thursday there's a boy scout who helps an old lady carry her
      groceries across the street. this might seem like something that's always
      <span class="yes">morally correct</span>. but there are scenarios where it's not
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        he's just doing it to get the "help someone across the road merit badge" and
        doesn't really care about the old lady at all. this isn't really evil, but it
        <span class="maybe">isn't super great</span> either, because it's self-serving
      </li>
      <li>
        he's doing it because she doesn't have any surviving relatives, so he thinks of
        it as a way to gently insert himself into her life so when she has to write her
        will she thinks "what a nice young man, i am going to bequeath him all of my
        funds". this is <span class="no">bad</span> because it's manipulation
      </li>
      <li>
        when he puts down the part of her groceries he's carrying, at the threshold of
        her door, he makes a mental note of the interior so he can rob it later. this
        is <span class="no">fucked up</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      coming back to our question, what's making it moral vs immoral is the
      <b>intention</b> behind the action
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>agent</dt>
      <dd>the person acting in a way that we're analyzing</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      intention-based ethics was developed<span class="clarity">?#</span> by people
      like aristotle (responsible for <i>virtue theory</i>) and immanuel kant
      (responsible for <i>deontology</i>)
    </p>
    <h3>outcome</h3>
    <p>
      outcome-based ethics is an attempt to make ethics scientific. in the 19th century
      it was called <b>utilitarianism</b> but since the 20th century it's been called
      <b>consequentialism</b> more generally
    </p>
    <p>
      it was developed by people like jeremy bentham (<i>quantitative
      utilitarianism</i>) and john stuart mill (<i>qualitative utilitarianism</i>)
    </p>
    <h2>practical ethics</h2>

        when the baby isn't viable outside the womb
      </li>
      <li>
        what if the mother is 7 or 8 months pregnant and wins a cruise trip, but one of
        the stipulations is you can't go on the cruise if you're pregnant since they
        don't have anywhere you can like <span class="clarity">[</span>give birth at on

      ethical principles are meant to hold for everyone, insofar as one is intending to

    <h2>ethical conflict of duties</h2>
    <p>
      in ww2 the duty to protect innocent life far outweighed the duty to not lie when
      the gestapo knocked on your door and asked if you were harboring any jews
    </p>
    <p>
      there are also cases where there is no clear indication that one duty trumps

      cultural relativism is a false and dangerous theory

    <p>
      what if there were a culture that endorses, say, tyrannizing other cultures, because they
      have an ethical belief that says cultural relativism is false? by the cultural relativists'

      <b class="case">example 1.</b> the nazis had a doctrine of eugenics: that the european gene
      pool had become polluted, and that they could breed out certain traits they disliked. this
      resulted in the holocaust. what does the cultural relativist have to say about the nazi belief
      this was ethical? <i>that it was moral for them</i>, which is absurd
    </p>
    <p>
      <b class="case">example 2.</b> in some cultures it's viewed as immoral for women to feel pleasure
      during sex, so to prevent that from happening they
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation">surgically remove some or all
        of their vulva.</a> (this is something that still happens today.) again the cultural relativist
      would say that female genital mutilation is moral for the cultures that practice it, and again
      this is absurd
    </p>
    <p>
      what would a cultural relativist have to say about a person born in nazi germany, who thinks
      the eugenics policy is morally wrong and wants to resist? that that person is morally wrong
    </p>
    <p>review so far:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the doctrine is incoherent</li>
      <li>the argument is invalid</li>
      <li>the argument rests on two fundamental confusions</li>
      <li>
        the doctrine leads to the endorsement of the most despicable acts one can think of, both in
        other cultures and one's own
      </li>
      <li>the doctrine eliminates the possibility of external moral critique and interal reform</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      if we adopt cultural relativism we can also no longer make sense of moral progress. the cultural
      relativist can't say anything has "improved"! cultural relativism also doesn't allow for moral
      judgement across time
    </p>
    <p>what even is a culture?</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>culture</dt>
      <dd>the beliefs and practices a group of people have such that they form a social unit</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      a culture isn't just a state. subcultures are important to consider because they give more detail
      into what people believe. and that's what sociologists care about! so if you really want to figure
      out what someone believes, look at them individually! oh no, ethical subjectivism
    </p>
    <p>
      imagine you're an anthropologist, trying to analyze some culture, and trying to be a good cultural
      relativist as you were taught. you notice that if anyone showers more than once a day they are
      executed. "hmmm that doesn't seem morally right" you might think. then you realize there's a heavy
      water shortage, so if they do that they are stealing someone else's water. it's important to
      distinguish between a moral principle and its application to a concrete circumstance
    </p>
    <ol start="6">
      <li>the doctrine cannot allow for or make sense of moral progress</li>
      <li>the doctrine, when brought to its logical limit, reduces to ethical subjectivism</li>
      <li>
        in some cases the doctrine overemphasizes differences that are only apparent upon further
        consideration
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>therefore cultural relativism is incoherent, false, and dangerous</p>
