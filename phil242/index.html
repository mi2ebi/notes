    <h1>what is philosophy?</h1>
    <p><i>philosophy</i> comes from two greek words</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ruby><i lang="grc">φῐ́λος</i><rp>(</rp><rt>phĭ́los</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
        'beloved, friendly'
      </li>
      <li>
        <ruby><i lang="grc">σοφῐ́ᾱ</i><rp>(</rp><rt>sophĭ́ā</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
        'wisdom'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>what's wisdom? necessary conditions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>get clear on <i>what</i> you believe</li>
      <li>get clear on <i>why</i> you believe it</li>
      <li>ask if the reasons <i>justify</i> the belief</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      what's justification? at minimum, would any rational, unbiased person
      agree that the reasons given are <i>at least relevant to</i> the belief?
    </p>
    <h1>metaphysics</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>metaphysics</dt>
      <dd>
        the study of (a) <i>what</i> exists and (b)
        <i>the way or manner in which</i> it exists
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p><b>(a)</b> what do people have trouble determining the existence of?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>quarks</li>
      <li>redness</li>
      <li>love</li>
      <li>god</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>(b)</b> if eg god does exist, what properties does he have?</p>
    <p>
      according to judeochristian tradition, god is omnipotent (all-powerful),
      omniscient (all-knowing), omnibenevolent (all-good), and "eternal".
      theologians actually define <i>eternal</i> as "existing outside space and
      time"
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>ontology</dt>
      <dd>the list of entities one claims exist</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>sample ontology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>rocks</li>
      <li>cats</li>
      <li>people</li>
      <li>the number 1</li>
      <li>loopholes in the law</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      how are eg rocks and cats similar? for one they're both tangible, or we
      could call them
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>matieral items</dt>
      <dd>capable of physical subdivision</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      how rocks and cats differ? rocks and cats can both move, but cats can move
      volitionally (making them <b>animate</b>) and rocks can't (because they're
      <b>inanimate</b>)
    </p>
    <p>
      what about cats vs people? people are also animate. how do people differ
      from other animals?
    </p>
    <p>
      we're not alone in eg our usage of tools - some other animals can use
      tools for example
    </p>
    <p>we're also not the only social animals, hm...</p>
    <p>
      the classic dividing line is that we can acquire and use languages. other
      animals can communicate but that doesn't necessarily mean they have a
      language. for example bird calls aren't a language because they don't have
      enough variation in meaning. but maybe eg dolphin sounds are, we don't
      know. if it is a language, maybe dolphins in different parts of the ocean
      have different 'accents'

    <p>
      what about the number 1? unlike rocks and cats and people, the number 1
      isn't a material item! it's abstract. does the number 1 exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      would numbers exist if people never existed? a <b>realist</b> woud say
      yes. an <b>anti-realist / pragmatist</b> would say no.
    </p>
    <p>
      would loopholes in the law exist if people never existed? i think not,
      because laws are made by people. people are necessary for "loopholes in
      the law" to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      some mathematicians claim to "invent" math, and others claim to "discover"
      it. if they discovered it, it must have already existed. we discovered
      mars but mars existed before people
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>platonic realism</dt>
      <dd>
        mathematical objects are abstract, objective, and mind-independent
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      flowers and pinecones and things have the fibonacci sequence in them via
      spirals and things
    </p>
    <p>the existence of numbers is actualy an unresolved question</p>
    <p>
      an argument for pragmatism would be that any number can form the base of a
      number system. we use 10 because we usually have that many fingers. but
      some people like 12 or 6 or 2

    <h1>epistemology p1</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>epistemology</dt>
      <dd>the study of knowledge (...hm)</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>epistemologists try to answer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>what can/do we know?</li>
      <li>
        what can/do we know with <b>certainty</b>?<br />
        (ie without the possibility of any doubt)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      it's also useful to distinguish <i>in principle</i> vs <i>in practice</i>.
      in principle, we could know the soil composition of any planet in the universe.
      in practice we can't though, because our telescopes etc aren't that good
    </p>
    <p>edge cases: can we know, in principle, infinity? human consciousness?</p>

    <h1>epistemology p2</h1>
    <h2><i>the first meditation: on what can be called into doubt</i></h2>
    <p><b>&para;1.</b>
      descartes is demolishing his existing beliefs so he can have a stable foundation
      for new ones, both for his own benefit and for the benefit of philosophy as
      what-was-then-considered-a-science.
    </p>
    <p><b>&para;2.</b>
      examining each individual belief would take literally forever. so we can just
      find <i>some</i> reason to doubt each of them. here again he can go directly to
      the foundation
    </p>
    <p><b>&para;3.</b> namely, his senses</p>
    <p><small>nb: descartes likes playing devils advocate with himself</small></p>
    <p>
      <b>argument from ordinary sense deception</b><br />
      <b>(p1)</b> it is unwise to trust anything that has decieved us even once<br />
      <b>(p2)</b> our senses sometimes decieve us<br />
      <b>(c)</b> we can never trust our senses
    </p>
    <p>
      this argument fails because cases of sense deception are eminently correctable
    </p>
    <p><b>&para;4.</b>
      but some beliefs that come from his senses are impossible to doubt
    </p>
    <p><b>&para;5.</b>
      he also can't doubt that eg his hands are his; if he did he would be insane,
      right?
    </p>
    <p>well, per the definition of wisdom,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        get clear on <i>what</i> you believe<br />
        <span class="yes">i am certain my hand exists</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        get clear on <i>why</i> you believe it<br />
        <span class="yes">i can see, feel, ..., sense my hand</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>&para;6-7.</b>
      there isn't a reliable way to tell if you're dreaming or not.
      in a dream, if someone asked you "hey does your hand exist",
      <span class="clarity">dream!</span>you would still say yes
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>dream argument</b><br />
      <b>(p)</b> there is no clear and certain way to distinguish dreams from reality
      <br />

    <ul>
      <li>
        what would normally be in our everyday ontology, but is now cast into doubt?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>well that'd be everything</p>
    <ul>
      <li>what can we still be certain of?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>our own minds. <i lang="la">cōgitō ergō sum</i></p>

      <li>our own mind</li>
      <li>math</li>

      in meditation 2 descartes finds a way to cast even mathematics into doubt but
      we're not going to cover that

    <p>
      this is <b>external world skepticism</b>. we're not saying the external world
